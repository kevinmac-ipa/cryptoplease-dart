## Architecture overview

We use BLoC-inspired architecture with BLoCs as pure business-logic components and Functional Programming principles in mind.

All the states and events are immutable `freezed` classes.

## `espressocash_app` package structure

### `core`

Core feature modules, other feature modules are free to depend on them.

### `features`

Feature modules. They are free to depend on `core` modules, but the dependencies on other `feature` modules should be avoided.

### `l10n`

Everything related to the localization and internationalization.

### `app`

Main app screens. It should be kept minimal and serve as an entrypoint to features.
